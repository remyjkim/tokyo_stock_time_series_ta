# tokyo_stock_time_series_ta

## Description
This project was done as a semester long project from CIS545 Big Data Analysis.
We use a wide variety of prediction models from time-series prediction models such as garch to deep learning based models such as temporal fusion transformers.
We use various features from ta-lib and conduct features selection process to maximize the prediction performance.

## Tools 
In this project we have used:
- ta-lib: technical anaylsis library for over 100 technical analysis indicator
- PyTorch : We use Temporal Fusion Transformer as well as some basic RNN, GRU models to predict the price of stocks

## Analysis
- Data exploration and Wrangling
- Basic Time Series Analysis
- Time series prediction
- Stock price movement classification
